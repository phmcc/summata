Model selection is a fundamental problem in applied statistics. Given a set of candidate models, it is important to determine which specification best balances goodness-of-fit against parsimony. Traditional approaches rely on information criteria (AIC, BIC), discrimination metrics (C-statistic), and hypothesis tests for nested models. The `compfit()` function synthesizes these metrics to facilitate systematic model comparison.

# Preliminaries

The examples in this vignette use the `clintrial` dataset included with `summata`:

```{r setup}
library(summata)

data(clintrial)
data(clintrial_labels)
```

# Theoretical Background

## Information Criteria

Information criteria penalize model complexity to prevent overfitting:

**Akaike Information Criterion (AIC):**
$$\text{AIC} = -2\log L + 2k$$

**Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC):**
$$\text{BIC} = -2\log L + k\log n$$

where *L* is the maximized likelihood, *k* is the number of parameters, and *n* is the sample size. Lower values indicate better fit-complexity tradeoff. BIC penalizes complexity more heavily than AIC.

## Discrimination Metrics

The concordance statistic (C-statistic) measures a model's ability to discriminate between outcomes:

- **C = 0.5**: No discrimination (equivalent to random)
- **C = 0.7–0.8**: Acceptable discrimination
- **C = 0.8–0.9**: Excellent discrimination
- **C > 0.9**: Outstanding discrimination

For survival models, this corresponds to Harrell's C-index.

## Pseudo-*R*²

For generalized linear models, McFadden's pseudo-*R*² provides an analog to the coefficient of determination:

$$R^2_{\text{McFadden}} = 1 - \frac{\log L_{\text{full}}}{\log L_{\text{null}}}$$

Values typically range from 0.2–0.4 for well-fitting models.

# Basic Usage

## Function Signature

Models are specified as a named list of predictor vectors:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
compfit(data, outcome, model_list, model_type, ...)
```

## **Example 1:** Nested Model Comparison

Compare models with increasing complexity:

```{r}
example1 <- compfit(
  data = clintrial,
  outcome = "surgery",
  model_list = list(
    "Demographics" = c("age", "sex"),
    "Plus Stage" = c("age", "sex", "stage", "ecog"),
    "Full Model" = c("age", "sex", "stage", "ecog", "treatment", "smoking")
  ),
  model_type = "glm"
)

example1
```

The output includes the following metrics:

| Metric | Interpretation |
|:-------|:---------------|
| Summata Score | Composite metric (0–100, higher is better) |
| N | Sample size |
| Events | Number of outcome events |
| Predictors | Number of model parameters |
| Converged | Convergence status |
| AIC/BIC | Information criteria (lower is better) |
| Pseudo-*R*² | Explained variation |
| Concordance | Discrimination (higher is better) |
| Brier Score | Prediction accuracy (lower is better) |
| Global *p* | Overall model significance |

## **Example 2:** Cox Regression Models

For time-to-event outcomes, use `model_type = "coxph"`:

```{r}
example2 <- compfit(
  data = clintrial,
  outcome = "Surv(os_months, os_status)",
  model_list = list(
    "Unadjusted" = c("treatment"),
    "Demographics" = c("treatment", "age", "sex"),
    "Full" = c("treatment", "age", "sex", "stage", "ecog")
  ),
  model_type = "coxph"
)

example2
```

## **Example 3:** Linear Regression Models

For continuous outcomes, use `model_type = "lm"`:

```{r}
example3 <- compfit(
  data = clintrial,
  outcome = "los_days",
  model_list = list(
    "Simple" = c("age", "sex"),
    "Disease" = c("age", "sex", "stage", "ecog"),
    "Treatment" = c("age", "sex", "stage", "ecog", "surgery", "treatment")
  ),
  model_type = "lm"
)

example3
```

# Interaction Testing

A key application of `compfit()` is testing whether interaction terms improve model fit.

## **Example 4:** Single Interaction

Compare a main-effects model to one with an interaction term:

```{r}
example4 <- compfit(
  data = clintrial,
  outcome = "surgery",
  model_list = list(
    "Main Effects" = c("age", "treatment", "sex"),
    "With Interaction" = c("age", "treatment", "sex")
  ),
  interactions_list = list(
    NULL,
    c("sex:treatment")
  ),
  model_type = "glm"
)

example4
```

## **Example 5:** Multiple Interactions

Compare different interaction hypotheses:

```{r}
example5 <- compfit(
  data = clintrial,
  outcome = "Surv(os_months, os_status)",
  model_list = list(
    "Main Effects" = c("age", "treatment", "sex", "stage"),
    "Age × Treatment" = c("age", "treatment", "sex", "stage"),
    "Sex × Treatment" = c("age", "treatment", "sex", "stage"),
    "Both" = c("age", "treatment", "sex", "stage")
  ),
  interactions_list = list(
    NULL,
    c("age:treatment"),
    c("sex:treatment"),
    c("age:treatment", "sex:treatment")
  ),
  model_type = "coxph"
)

example5
```

# Accessing Detailed Results

## Coefficient Comparison

Setting `include_coefficients = TRUE` generates a table comparing coefficients across models:

```{r}
example6 <- compfit(
  data = clintrial,
  outcome = "surgery",
  model_list = list(
    "Model A" = c("age", "sex"),
    "Model B" = c("age", "sex", "stage"),
    "Model C" = c("age", "sex", "stage", "treatment")
  ),
  model_type = "glm",
  include_coefficients = TRUE,
  labels = clintrial_labels
)

# Main comparison
example6

# Coefficient table
coef_table <- attr(example6, "coefficients")
coef_table
```

## Fitted Model Objects

The underlying model objects are stored as attributes for further analysis:

```{r}
models <- attr(example6, "models")
names(models)

# Examine a specific model
summary(models[["Model C"]])
```

## Recommended Model

The best-performing model is identified automatically based on the Summata Score:

```{r}
example7 <- compfit(
  data = clintrial,
  outcome = "Surv(os_months, os_status)",
  model_list = list(
    "Minimal" = c("treatment"),
    "Standard" = c("treatment", "age", "sex", "stage"),
    "Extended" = c("treatment", "age", "sex", "stage", "ecog", "grade")
  ),
  model_type = "coxph"
)

recommended <- attr(example7, "recommended")
cat("Recommended model:", recommended, "\n")
```

# The Summata Score

The Summata Score is a composite metric designed to facilitate rapid model comparison. It combines multiple quality indicators into a single value ranging from 0 to 100.

## Score Interpretation

| Range | Interpretation |
|:------|:---------------|
| 85–100 | Excellent |
| 75–84 | Very Good |
| 65–74 | Good |
| 55–64 | Fair |
| < 55 | Poor |

## Default Weights by Model Type

The score components and their default weights vary by model type.

**Linear regression (`lm`):**

| Component | Weight |
|:----------|:-------|
| Convergence | 15% |
| AIC | 25% |
| Adjusted *R*² | 45% |
| RMSE | 15% |

**Logistic regression (`glm`):**

| Component | Weight |
|:----------|:-------|
| Convergence | 15% |
| AIC | 25% |
| Concordance | 40% |
| Pseudo-*R*² | 15% |
| Brier Score | 5% |

**Cox regression (`coxph`):**

| Component | Weight |
|:----------|:-------|
| Convergence | 15% |
| AIC | 30% |
| Concordance | 40% |
| Global *p* | 15% |

## Custom Weights

Modify the scoring weights to emphasize specific metrics:

```{r}
example8 <- compfit(
  data = clintrial,
  outcome = "surgery",
  model_list = list(
    "Simple" = c("age", "sex"),
    "Standard" = c("age", "sex", "stage"),
    "Full" = c("age", "sex", "stage", "treatment", "ecog")
  ),
  model_type = "glm",
  scoring_weights = list(
    convergence = 0.05,
    aic = 0.20,
    concordance = 0.60,
    pseudo_r2 = 0.10,
    brier = 0.05
  )
)

# Application Scenarios

## Confounder Assessment

Evaluate the impact of covariate adjustment on effect estimates:

```{r}
scenario1 <- compfit(
  data = clintrial,
  outcome = "Surv(os_months, os_status)",
  model_list = list(
    "Crude" = c("treatment"),
    "Age-Sex Adjusted" = c("treatment", "age", "sex"),
    "Fully Adjusted" = c("treatment", "age", "sex", "stage", "ecog")
  ),
  model_type = "coxph",
  include_coefficients = TRUE,
  labels = clintrial_labels
)

scenario1

# Compare treatment effect across models
attr(scenario1, "coefficients")
```

## Variable Selection Validation

Compare automated versus theory-driven selection:

```{r}
# Identify candidates via screening
screening <- uniscreen(
  data = clintrial,
  outcome = "surgery",
  predictors = c("age", "sex", "bmi", "smoking", "diabetes",
                 "hypertension", "stage", "ecog", "treatment"),
  model_type = "glm",
  p_threshold = 0.10
)

# Extract significant predictors
sig_vars <- unique(attr(screening, "raw_data")$variable)

scenario2 <- compfit(
  data = clintrial,
  outcome = "surgery",
  model_list = list(
    "Theory-Driven" = c("age", "sex", "stage", "treatment"),
    "Data-Driven" = sig_vars,
    "Combined" = unique(c("age", "sex", "stage", "treatment", sig_vars))
  ),
  model_type = "glm"
)

scenario2
```

## Parsimony Assessment

Test whether additional predictors meaningfully improve fit:

```{r}
scenario3 <- compfit(
  data = clintrial,
  outcome = "los_days",
  model_list = list(
    "3 Predictors" = c("age", "surgery", "ecog"),
    "5 Predictors" = c("age", "surgery", "ecog", "stage", "treatment"),
    "8 Predictors" = c("age", "surgery", "ecog", "stage", "treatment",
                       "sex", "smoking", "diabetes")
  ),
  model_type = "lm",
  labels = clintrial_labels
)

scenario3
```

# Best Practices

## When to Compare Models

1. **Covariate selection**: Determine appropriate adjustment level
2. **Interaction testing**: Evaluate effect modification
3. **Parsimony**: Balance complexity against fit
4. **Sensitivity analysis**: Compare different specifications

## Interpreting Results

1. **Multiple metrics**: The Summata Score provides a summary, but examine individual metrics
2. **Practical significance**: Statistical improvement may not translate to meaningful differences
3. **Sample size**: Complex models require larger samples
4. **Convergence**: Non-converged models should be interpreted cautiously

## Limitations

1. The Summata Score is a heuristic, not a formal statistical test
2. Comparisons assume models are fit on identical observations
3. Information criteria are most meaningful for nested models
4. Small score differences may not be practically significant

---

# Common Issues

## Non-Convergence

Check convergence status and consider simplifying non-converging models:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Check convergence status
comparison[, .(Model, Converged)]

# For non-converging models:
# 1. Reduce complexity
# 2. Check for separation (logistic)
# 3. Examine predictor correlations
```

## Differing Sample Sizes

Models with missing data may have different sample sizes, which complicates comparison:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Check sample sizes
comparison[, .(Model, N, Events)]

# Use complete cases for fair comparison
complete_data <- na.omit(data[, relevant_vars, with = FALSE])
```

## Interpreting Close Scores

When scores are similar, prefer parsimony and consider domain knowledge:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Examine individual metrics
comparison[, .(Model, `Summata Score`, AIC, Concordance)]

# Prefer parsimony when scores are close
# Consider interpretability
```
