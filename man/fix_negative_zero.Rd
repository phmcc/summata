\usage{
fix_negative_zero(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Character vector of formatted numbers.}
}
\value{
Character vector with negative zeros corrected.
}
\description{
Corrects floating-point rounding artifacts that produce "-0.00" or similar
negative zero strings. Works on character vectors, replacing patterns like
"-0.00", "-0.000", etc. with their positive equivalents, even when embedded
within larger strings (e.g., "(-0.00, 1.23)" becomes "(0.00, 1.23)").
