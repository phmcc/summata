\title{Detect available sans-serif font for plots}
\usage{
detect_plot_font()
}
\value{
Character string with the font family name to use.
}
\description{
Checks for commonly available sans-serif fonts in order of preference
(Helvetica, Arial, Helvetica Neue) and returns the first available one.
Falls back to "sans" if none are found or if systemfonts is unavailable.
}
\details{
When ragg is being used as the graphics device (detected via options or
knitr settings), font detection works in non-interactive sessions since
ragg handles font rendering independently of the R graphics system.
