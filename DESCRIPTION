Description: A comprehensive framework for regression analysis that produces 
    publication-ready tables and forest plots. Provides a unified interface 
    from descriptive statistics through multivariable modeling, with support 
    for linear models, generalized linear models, Cox proportional hazards, 
    and mixed-effects models. Includes univariable screening, multi-outcome 
    analysis, model comparison, and export to multiple formats including PDF, 
    Word, PowerPoint, LaTeX, HTML, and RTF. Built on 'data.table' for 
    computational efficiency.
