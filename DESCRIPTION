Description: A comprehensive framework for descriptive statistics and regression
    analysis that produces publication-ready tables and forest plots. Provides a
    unified interface from descriptive statistics through multivariable modeling,
    with support for linear models, generalized linear models, Cox proportional
    hazards, and mixed-effects models. Also includes univariable screening, 
    multivariate analysis, model comparison, and export to multiple formats
    including PDF, Word, PowerPoint, LaTeX, HTML, and RTF. Built on 'data.table'
    for computational efficiency.
